## Prompt 1 — Report Integrity Repair and Benchmark Execution Gate

Date: 2026-04-30

### Goal

Repair the append-only report requirement, reconcile prior benchmark/runtime hardening work that was recorded outside `report.md`, and confirm whether the Real Target AI Benchmark Execution Phase can begin.

### Files Inspected

- `README.md`
- `START_HERE.md`
- `KB_REBUILD_INSTRUCTION.md`
- `GITHUB_TRUTH_SYNC_REPORT.md`
- `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
- `SOURCE_GOVERNANCE_AUDIT.md`
- `UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`
- `UPDATED_TODO.md`
- `AI_MASTER_BENCHMARK_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW.md`
- `AI_MASTER_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW.md`
- `AI_MASTER_READINESS_REPORT.md`
- `AI_MASTER_NEXT_PHASE_DECISION.md`
- `AI_MASTER_BENCHMARK_DASHBOARD.md`
- `AI_MASTER_BENCHMARK_RUN_002.md`
- `AI_MASTER_SCORING_RUBRIC.md`
- `AI_MASTER_FAILURE_MODES.md`
- `report.md`

### report.md Status

`report.md` did not exist before this prompt. It was created as the canonical append-only repository report.

Because this is the first `report.md`, there was no previous content to preserve. Future updates must append new dated sections and must not delete, rewrite, truncate, reorder, or clean existing report sections.

### Whether Previous Content Was Missing

Yes. Prior benchmark/runtime hardening work was recorded in `UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`, but there was no `report.md` entry for it because `report.md` was absent.

### Reconciliation Summary

The missing report history is reconciled here without deleting or moving the old log:

- The AI Master Benchmark and Runtime Hardening final review was completed on 2026-04-29.
- `AI_MASTER_BENCHMARK_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW.md` was created.
- `AI_MASTER_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW.md` was created.
- `AI_MASTER_READINESS_REPORT.md` was updated.
- `AI_MASTER_REMAINING_GAP_BACKLOG.md` was created.
- `AI_MASTER_NEXT_PHASE_DECISION.md` was created.
- Benchmark Run 001 and Run 002 remained blocked pending real target AI outputs.
- No benchmark outputs were fabricated.
- No benchmark scores were fabricated.
- No claims were promoted.
- No source bodies were parsed.

### Benchmark Execution Readiness

Run 002 is structurally ready for real target AI output collection:

- Run 002 has 20 cases.
- Run 002 includes 15 comparable smoke cases and 5 adversarial cases.
- No target outputs have been collected.
- No cases have been scored from target outputs.
- Missing outputs must remain unscored.
- Target AI identity must be recorded before collection.
- Raw target outputs must be preserved without editing.
- P0 failures must be preserved and not minimized.

### Source Governance Status

Source governance status: PASS.

No high-risk or private source body text was parsed, summarized, quoted, embedded, or transformed during this task. No legal sidecars, user notes, manual quotes, project facts, playtest logs, EvidenceRefs, or verified claims were invented.

### Validation Status

Validation status after final command run: PASS.

- `npm run kb:export`: PASS.
- `npm run kb:validate`: PASS.
- `npm run kb:audit`: PASS.
- `npm run kb:coverage`: PASS.

### Files Changed

- `report.md`
- `REPORT_INTEGRITY_AUDIT.md`
- `BENCHMARK_EXECUTION_GATE.md`
- `AI_MASTER_BENCHMARK_PHASE_2_PLAN.md`
- `AI_MASTER_BENCHMARK_TARGET_OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- generated import/export, validation, audit, and coverage reports updated by commands

### Commands Run

- `npm run kb:export`
- `npm run kb:validate`
- `npm run kb:audit`
- `npm run kb:coverage`

### Blockers

- Real target AI outputs have not been supplied.
- Benchmark scoring remains blocked until raw target outputs are collected.
- Verified source-backed masterclass remains blocked pending user/legal evidence.
