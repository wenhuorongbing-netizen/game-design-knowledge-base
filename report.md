## Prompt 1 — Report Integrity Repair and Benchmark Execution Gate

Date: 2026-04-30

### Goal

Repair the append-only report requirement, reconcile prior benchmark/runtime hardening work that was recorded outside `report.md`, and confirm whether the Real Target AI Benchmark Execution Phase can begin.

### Files Inspected

- `README.md`
- `START_HERE.md`
- `KB_REBUILD_INSTRUCTION.md`
- `GITHUB_TRUTH_SYNC_REPORT.md`
- `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
- `SOURCE_GOVERNANCE_AUDIT.md`
- `UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`
- `UPDATED_TODO.md`
- `AI_MASTER_BENCHMARK_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW.md`
- `AI_MASTER_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW.md`
- `AI_MASTER_READINESS_REPORT.md`
- `AI_MASTER_NEXT_PHASE_DECISION.md`
- `AI_MASTER_BENCHMARK_DASHBOARD.md`
- `AI_MASTER_BENCHMARK_RUN_002.md`
- `AI_MASTER_SCORING_RUBRIC.md`
- `AI_MASTER_FAILURE_MODES.md`
- `report.md`

### report.md Status

`report.md` did not exist before this prompt. It was created as the canonical append-only repository report.

Because this is the first `report.md`, there was no previous content to preserve. Future updates must append new dated sections and must not delete, rewrite, truncate, reorder, or clean existing report sections.

### Whether Previous Content Was Missing

Yes. Prior benchmark/runtime hardening work was recorded in `UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`, but there was no `report.md` entry for it because `report.md` was absent.

### Reconciliation Summary

The missing report history is reconciled here without deleting or moving the old log:

- The AI Master Benchmark and Runtime Hardening final review was completed on 2026-04-29.
- `AI_MASTER_BENCHMARK_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW.md` was created.
- `AI_MASTER_RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE_REVIEW.md` was created.
- `AI_MASTER_READINESS_REPORT.md` was updated.
- `AI_MASTER_REMAINING_GAP_BACKLOG.md` was created.
- `AI_MASTER_NEXT_PHASE_DECISION.md` was created.
- Benchmark Run 001 and Run 002 remained blocked pending real target AI outputs.
- No benchmark outputs were fabricated.
- No benchmark scores were fabricated.
- No claims were promoted.
- No source bodies were parsed.

### Benchmark Execution Readiness

Run 002 is structurally ready for real target AI output collection:

- Run 002 has 20 cases.
- Run 002 includes 15 comparable smoke cases and 5 adversarial cases.
- No target outputs have been collected.
- No cases have been scored from target outputs.
- Missing outputs must remain unscored.
- Target AI identity must be recorded before collection.
- Raw target outputs must be preserved without editing.
- P0 failures must be preserved and not minimized.

### Source Governance Status

Source governance status: PASS.

No high-risk or private source body text was parsed, summarized, quoted, embedded, or transformed during this task. No legal sidecars, user notes, manual quotes, project facts, playtest logs, EvidenceRefs, or verified claims were invented.

### Validation Status

## Prompt 5 — Run 002 Failure Analysis and Source-Safety Audit

Date: 2026-04-30

### Goal

Analyze Run 002 response failures and source-safety behavior without inventing outputs or minimizing P0 risks.

### Main Failure Categories

Main observed failure category: operational missing-output block.

All requested response failure categories are marked `not_evaluable_no_outputs` because no real target AI outputs were collected.

### P0 Safety Findings

P0 safety findings: not_evaluable_no_outputs.

No P0 source-safety failure can be confirmed or cleared because there are no raw responses. This is not a behavioral safety pass; it is a blocked audit state.

### P1 Quality Findings

P1 quality findings: not_evaluable_no_outputs.

No generic advice, routing, lens, workflow, artifact, or uncertainty-handling failures can be confirmed because no target responses exist.

### Goal

Collect or document the absence of raw target AI outputs for Benchmark Run 002 while preserving benchmark integrity.

### Number Of Responses Collected

Responses collected: 0.

No target AI outputs were supplied in the prompt. No target responses were generated, edited, summarized, cleaned, or scored.

### Number Waiting

Responses waiting: 20.

All Run 002 cases remain marked `waiting_for_target_ai_output`.

## Prompt 4 — Score Run 002 with P0 Failure Detection

Date: 2026-04-30

### Goal

Score only real collected target AI outputs for Benchmark Run 002 and preserve missing responses as unscored.

### Scored Case Count

Scored cases: 0.

No target AI outputs were supplied, so no case was eligible for scoring.

### Missing Case Count

Missing cases: 20.

All Run 002 cases remain `not_scored_missing_response`.

### P0 Failure Count

P0 failure count: not_applicable_no_responses_scored.

No response-level P0 failures can be evaluated until raw target outputs exist. No P0 failure was softened or hidden.

### Average Score

Average score: not_applicable.

No numeric score was created because there were no collected responses.

### Next Exact Prompt

`collect-run-002-target-ai-outputs`

## Prompt 6 — Repair Prompt Library and Runtime from Real Failures

Date: 2026-04-30

### Goal

Repair prompt-library and runtime behavior only where real Run 002 failures prove a defect.

### Failure Categories Repaired

Failure categories repaired: none.

Run 002 has no collected target AI outputs, no scored responses, and no response-level failure evidence. Repairs based on missing outputs would be imaginary, so no prompt or runtime behavior was changed.

### Files Changed

- `AI_MASTER_PROMPT_REPAIR_REPORT_RUN_002.md`
- `AI_MASTER_PROMPT_CHANGELOG_RUN_002.md`
- `AI_MASTER_RUNTIME_REPAIR_REPORT_RUN_002.md`
- `AI_MASTER_PROMPT_SELF_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`
- `report.md`
- generated import/export, validation, and audit reports updated by commands

### Prompt Changes

Prompt changes: none.

All prompt templates remain unchanged because Run 002 did not produce real outputs that demonstrate prompt-level defects.

### Runtime Changes

Runtime changes: none.

The runtime pack, runtime safety rules, response formats, prompt selector, and uncertainty/source rules remain unchanged because no real Run 002 runtime failure exists.

### Source-Safety Changes

Source-safety changes: preserved and gated.

The prompt self-review checklist now states that future prompt repairs require real response evidence, case traceability, a failure category, and source-safety impact. No source-safety rule was weakened.

### Validation Result

Validation result after final command run: PASS.

- exported entities: 859
- exported relationships: 8405
- search documents: 737
- issues: 0
- P0 issues: 0

## Prompt 7 — Regression Run 003 After Repairs

Date: 2026-04-30

### Goal

Prepare Regression Run 003 after the Run 002 repair gate, and run it only if real target outputs are supplied.

### Run 003 Case Count

Run 003 case count: 13.

- Run 002 failed cases: 0, because Run 002 had no scored responses.
- Run 002 P0 adversarial cases: 5.
- additional prompt stress cases: 3.
- additional routing stress cases: 3.
- insufficient-context case: 1.
- source-safety trap case: 1.

### Outputs Collected Or Waiting

- outputs collected: 0.
- outputs waiting: 13.
- target model identity: not supplied.

No target AI outputs were supplied. No responses were fabricated, edited, scored, or compared.

### Score Summary If Scored

Score summary: not_applicable.

No case was scored because no real target output exists.

### Regression Comparison

Regression comparison: not_evaluable_no_outputs.

Run 002 had no scored outputs and Run 003 currently has no collected outputs. No improvement, unchanged behavior, or regression can be claimed.

## Prompt 8 — Update Capability and Domain Readiness from Real Scores

Date: 2026-04-30

### Goal

Update capability and domain readiness using only real benchmark scores.

### Scored Case Count

Scored case count: 0.

Run 002 scored cases: 0.

Run 003 scored cases: 0.

No target AI outputs were supplied, so no score, pass rate, P0 count, P1 count, improvement claim, or readiness upgrade was created.

### Capability Readiness Summary

Capability readiness: blocked_pending_target_outputs.

All 14 master capabilities have static benchmark coverage but zero scored target responses. No capability is marked weak, usable, strong, or master_ready.

### Domain Readiness Summary

Domain readiness: blocked_pending_target_outputs.

All 19 master domains have static benchmark coverage but zero scored target responses. No domain is marked weak, usable, strong, or master_ready.

### Blockers

- Real target AI outputs are still required.
- Run 003 target model identity is still required.
- Raw target outputs must be preserved before scoring.
- Capability and domain readiness cannot advance without scored evidence.
